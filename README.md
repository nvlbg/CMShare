=======

This is one of my previous hobby projects. It is a simple CMS. It has the following functionality (and more):

- users (register/login)
- profiles
- posts (with categories and tags)
- comments
- personal messages
- search
- contact form

The admin panel has the following functionality:

- Add/edit/delete post
- Add/edit/delete user
- Edit site's visuals
- Edit system settings
- View users feedback
- Edit/delete comments
- more

The CMS uses these technologies:

- PHP (5+)
- My own PHP MVC framework
- MySQL database
- HTML5, CSS3, Javascript (and some js libs)
